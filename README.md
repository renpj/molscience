# molscience
As a theoretical chemist, I use multiple theoretical methods, both quantum machanism based and force field based, such as DFT, molecular dynamics, monte carlo. These methods are implemented by separate softwares. Furthermore, there are amount of tools for modelling, analysis and database. Their functions may overlap, but the quality, licence and user-friendness are quiet different. Find and choose the proper one from them is not easy even for old birds, much less for newbies. This site not only collect the popular molecular simulation softwares, dispersed scripts, websites and related journals, but categorize them, track their updates and join them together.

## Features

 * Selective molecular simulation softwares, dispersed scripts, websites and related journals.
 * Intellectual management and upating.
 * Alternative software suggestion.
 * Powered by Django with Python.
 * Flexible Tag support.

## TODO Functions

  * Short Term
    * use django_comments_xtd to styling comments
    * User registeration
    * Disquz
    * Card view.
    * More items
    * Researchers.

  *  Long Term
    * Add wiki-like function: history, auto internal link, auto wiki link;
    * Tag or category synopsis.
    * Software citation
    * use Semantic-UI instead of Bootstrap and Foundation UI
    * imitate djangosnippets.org
